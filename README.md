# 🔌 Basic and Universal Logic Gates in Verilog

## 📘 Project Overview
This project presents the design and simulation of basic and universal logic gates using Verilog HDL. Each logic gate is implemented as a separate module and verified through corresponding testbenches. The project is intended as a learning aid for beginners in digital design and hardware description languages.

### Implemented Gates:
- Basic Gates: AND, OR, NOT, XOR, XNOR
- Universal Gates: NAND, NOR

## 🛠️ Tools and Technologies
- **Language:** Verilog HDL
- **Simulator:** Icarus Verilog
- **Platform:** EDA Playground

## 📁 Project Structure

| Folder | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `gates/` | Verilog source files for each logic gate |
| `testbenches/` | Testbench files for verifying logic gate functionality |
| `waveform_screenshots/` | Simulation waveform outputs for each gate |

## 🚀 How to Simulate
You can run the simulation using [EDA Playground](https://edaplayground.com/):

1. Paste your design and testbench code.
2. Select **Icarus Verilog** as the simulator.
3. Run simulation and view the waveform or console output.


## 🎯 Learning Outcomes
- Understand the behavior of logic gates at the gate level.
- Learn modular Verilog coding practices.
- Gain hands-on experience with simulation tools.
